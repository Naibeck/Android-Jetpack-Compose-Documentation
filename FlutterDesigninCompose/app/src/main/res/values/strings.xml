        Lake Oeschinen lies at the foot of the Bl√ºemlisalp in the Bernese
        Alps. Situated 1,578 meters above sea level, it is one of the
        larger Alpine Lakes. A gondola ride from Kandersteg, followed by a
        half-hour walk through pastures and pine forest, leads you to the
        lake, which warms to 20 degrees Celsius in the summer. Activities
        enjoyed here include rowing, and riding the summer toboggan run.
